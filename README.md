MY FAVORITE PART OF THE PROJECTS ARE THE READ ME WOOOOO.
Its a fairly super simple one that the group i was with came up with. 
I chose to only opt to having 1 dealership just to make things somewhat easier on my end, but i hope that the addition of 5 entries in every other table makes up for it!
If someone was to choose to add entries to this table, they should have no problem following the format i have laid out. It allowed me to add multiple entries to one table within one singular INSERT INTO command.
I like fast cars, and i like anime, and video games. 
I included 1 of my friends names as a staff member. Sadly i didnt expand the staff roles to included mechanic, salesperson, or whether they did both. But if i or someone else were to its an easy process.
